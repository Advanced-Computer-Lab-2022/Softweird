An implementation of full stack web application using the MERN stack. The application is a platform for users to manage an online learning platform. The application is built using the MERN stack.
  
## Motivation :star2:

This is a main project of **CSEN 704 Advanced Computer Lab** course. The prime goal of the project is to create a complete Online Learning System. An Online Learning System is a web application through which individuals can attend pre-recorded courses online. Existing web applications include but are not limited to Coursera, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, Great Learning and Udacity.

## Purpose :muscle:

- Learn to research and master the use of the **MERN Stack**.
- Learn how to properly use the **Agile Methodology** to plan out a project and develop the software.
- Learn the process of following a given set of **System Requirements** to develop a software.
- Learn how to work together as a team on GitHub.


## Tools and Frameworks :hammer_and_wrench:
![MERN Stack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60584447/146457684-e9f0bb67-605f-48ae-908e-590405719e85.png)
This project is fully implemented using the **MERN Stack**. *MERN* stands for *MongoDB*, *Express*, *React*, *Node*, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.
- *MongoDB* is an open-source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
- *Express* is a Node. js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It is the de facto standard server framework for node.
- *ReactJS* is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.
- *NodeJS* is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Coding Style :memo:
This project is divided into two main parts, frontend and backend. Our backend is divide into routes that act as a middle point between the client and the database. On the other hand, the frontend focuses on the coding and creation of elements and features of our website that will then be seen by the user (the client-side).


## Installation :inbox_tray:
In order to run our project, you should have the following installed in your machine:
 - [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 - [React JS](https://react-cn.github.io/react/downloads.html) or you can use `NPM`
 - And you can choose any text editor.
 - [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) either locally or on a cloud. You have to create `.env` with the dbconnectionString.
 - Code:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/Advanced-Computer-Lab-2022/Softweird/
```
```
cd Backend 
npm i 
npm run start-server
```
```
cd frontend 
npm i 
npm start
 ```
## Build Status :disappointed_relieved:
- If trainees search for all courses in the system in any other page than the home page, courses unpublished and closed will appear.
- Courses in the most viewed courses on the home page also has unpublished and closed courses.
- There are many static pics (or buttons) on the system that needs to have their functionalities created (sign in with google and facebook / graph / credit card details)
- Editing courses' video titles and subtitle titles after creation is not implemented but the button is present. 
- Reporting a specific course a trainee has a problem with is not entirely implemented (the backend is present but no button for it frontend)
- If a trainee finishes an exam lastly to reach a progress equal to 100, his status doesnâ€™t change to certified (and no certificateÂ isÂ sent).
- Paying for a course using credit card has many options but only one is implemented.

## Running Test :monocle_face:
The testing is done using `jest`. To run the tests, run the following command
```
npm run test
```
```

```
